Creating a music player app using Java and applying object-oriented programming (OOPs) concepts involves designing and organising the code in a way that represents real-world entities as objects and 
encapsulating their behaviour within those objects.

Class Structure:
* MusicPlayerApp: This is the main class representing the music player application. It will have methods for playing, pausing, stopping, and managing playlists.
* Song: A class to represent individual songs. It will have attributes like title, artist, duration, etc.
* Playlist: A class to represent a playlist containing multiple songs. It will have methods to add songs, remove songs, and play songs in sequence manner.
